By this stage I think of myself as a long-term corporate developer (for better or worse lol) when it comes to implementing and working with **Sitecore**. Over the years, I’ve built a career focused on creating and supporting large-scale digital experiences across enterprise businesses. Outside of work, I keep things balanced with **family time**, **rock climbing**, **golf**, and exploring great **food** — I’m definitely a bit of a foodie.

I started my Sitecore journey in **Brisbane**, working with some iconicly QLD organisations. Now I have recently moved back to Adelaide. I’m passionate about helping to grow and represent the Sitecore community here in **South Australia**, bringing the same level of technical depth and professionalism that I’ve honed throughout my career.

At **Aceik**, I work as a **Technical Architect**, leading implementations across **composable architectures** with a focus on **Sitecore XM Cloud**, **headless frameworks (Next.js/JSS)**, **Azure DevOps pipelines**, and **enterprise integration patterns**. My experience spans multiple sectors — **superannuation**, **non-for-profit**, **higher education**, and **retail** — where I’ve helped deliver scalable, secure, and user-centric digital platforms.

Before joining Aceik, I held senior Sitecore and .NET roles at **Australian Retirement Trust**, **Sunsuper**, **RSL Queensland**, **Australian Tax Office** and **Deloitte Digital**. Those years gave me a strong foundation in **Sitecore XP/XM**, **.NET development**, and **service-oriented architectures**, along with a deep respect for **precision engineering** and **long-term maintainability** — something I first developed back at the **University of South Australia**, where my tech career began.

After many years on the frontline, I am now finally making a real effort to contribute back to the community and to hopefully work with more people in Adelaide in setting up a footprint for Sitecore in Adelaide.
